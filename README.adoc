== Functionality
[.lead]
This figure depicts what this sample app does:

. HTTP call to a Pokémon Store to fetch random Pokémon names.
. It uses those names to query the DB and deduces matching and missing Pokémon in the DB.
. It then fetches powers for those missing Pokémon from the Store via HTTP and inserts them in the DB.

It uses *postgresql* for DB. `powers` is the only table in this DB with this simple schema:

== Module Dependency

This miniature is a multi-module project, that comprises 5 modules:

* `demo-before` — demos predominant coding and testing practices on the Core that makes unit-testing difficult
* `demo-now` — demos the solution to organically improve unit-test coverage
* `legacy` — This simulates legacy core modules. Assume you don’t have control over refactoring this module.
* `loki` — A simulated Loki module
* `loki-dud` — A simulated Dud module that contains Fakes

It's a simple gradle project, so just run this command after clone:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

Install Docker and run this command to get the Postgresql DB up

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

Run the main method from link:demo-now/src/main/java/ga/overfullstack/pokemon/now/App.kt[App.kt] and see it in action with link:demo-now/src/test/resources/pokemon.http[pokemon.http]
